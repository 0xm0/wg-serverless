# Proposals

Use this folder to submit proposals for new work streams related to the
CNCF Serverless Working Group.

To submit a new proposal, open a PR adding a new document to this
"proposals" folder and add an agenda item to the Serverless WG's
[agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OVF68rpuPK5shIHILK9JOqlZBbfe91RNzQ7u_P7YCDE/edit?ts=5a1da559#)
document to raise aware of the PR.

If the work stream extends the scope of the Working Group beyond what the
TOC has previously agreed to, then the request might need to be taken to
the TOC after the Working Group has agreed to it.

## Proposed Work Streams

### Events

At this moment the group decided to move forward with `open-events`
leveraging `Cloudevents` and `Open-CADF-events` content as input. The
on-going work for the current spec is hosted at
[https://github.com/cloudevents/spec](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec).
