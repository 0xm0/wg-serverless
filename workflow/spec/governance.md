# Serverless Workflow - Project Governance

As a CNCF member project, we abide by the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

## Review Process

Given that there are only 3 [owners](owners.md) at this time the review process is as follows:

* A Pull Request is submitted.
* Owners review the changes and can add comments and suggestions for the changes.
* After a review, owners can approve the changes by commenting on the PR with "LGTM" ("Looks good to me"), 
request changes to the PR with "CR" ("Changes requested"), or reject the PR with "NA" ("Not acceptable").
* Owners must provide an explanation for both "CR" and "NA" comments to the contributor.
* 2 "LGTM" comments by different owners are needed in order for a change to be accepted.
* If the contributor is an owner, then only 1 "LGTM" vote is needed.
* If there is an existing "LGTM" vote by a owner and another owner comments with "NA", then
the owners must work together to reach a concensus on the requested changes (preferably publicly including the contributor).

Note that as our contributors count increases we hope to add more owners and reviewers and update these rules accordingly.

## Conflict Resolution

If you have a technical dispute that you feel has reached an impasse with a
subset of the community, any contributor may open an issue, specifically
calling for a resolution vote of the current owners to resolve the dispute.
