Serverless applications are becoming increasingly complex. Nowdays they have to coordinate, manage, and define
the execution order (steps) for countless functions triggered by as many events.

Workflows have become key components of serverless applications as they excel at orchestration and coordination
of their functional flow. 

The goal of the Serverless Workflow sub-group is to come up with a standard way for users to specify their serverless application workflow, as well as help facilitate 
portability of serverless applications across different vendor platforms.

Serverless Workflow is a vendor-neutral and portable specification which meets these goals.
