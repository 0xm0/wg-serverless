# CNCF Serverless WG

The CNCF Serverless Working Group is exploring the intersection of cloud native and serverless technology.

The TOC sponsor of this WG is Ken Owens.

For more information, see this collaborative [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L9n9tkGuGtj7Ap9dVRes9RVscSoXeKsF3k-d2hJcDlg/edit).

## Goals

* Provide clarity for ourselves and consumers w.r.t. what this topic is all about:
  * Define common terminology
  * Define the scope of the space as it exists today - over time this may change
  * Identify common use cases and patterns between existing implementations
  * Identify where serverless fits in relative to PaaS and container orchestration
* Identify potential next steps for the community (may or may not happen within CNCF):
  * Identifying areas where we’d like to see some harmonization or interop work
* Create a white/position-paper on Serverless in relation to Cloud Native.

  * Create a white/position-paper on Serverless in relation to Cloud Native
     1 - Define terminology
     2 - Define scope of the space as it exists today

     4 - Identify where serverless fits in relative to PaaS and container orchestration
* Agree on process for collaboration/work - e.g.
  * One google doc for each section, then pull it all together later on
  * Use github/PRs once docs are a bit stable
* Assign lead(s) for each section - for cat herding purposes
  * Each group decides their schedule, meeting coordinates, etc...
  * Use bi-weekly meeting for status to the rest of the group & higher-order discussion topics
* Start to gather potential phase 2 work items:
  * Identify potential next steps for the community (may or may not happen within CNCF)
  * Identifying areas where we’d like to see some harmonization or interop work
* Other community involvement discussion
